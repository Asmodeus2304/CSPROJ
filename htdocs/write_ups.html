    		<h2>Fake News and Predictions</h2>
    		<h4>By Phenomela Ashley Mari O. Talabucon</h4>
    		<p>
					‘Fake news’ is a term that recently became popular. However, the idea has been around for a long time to even go as far back as centuries. It has only been recently considered a problem because of the internet. The internet made society more connected now. Information is easier to relay and ideas are easily spread. 
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			The internet is a double-edged sword. It can convey information easily but it cannot filter the information it spreads. It’s like pouring the contents from a container to another. All the contents in the previous container are poured into the new one no matter how small it is. To get the liquid only a filter must be put to take out the bad stuff. Sadly, it’s difficult to put a filter online.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			The answer is that there is no method to filter information online. Filtering information requires people viewing information and deciding if it’s allowed. It’s inefficient because of the manpower needed. In addition, online privacy is protected with laws protecting it. 
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			Seeing this dilemma, I predict that it will be a never-ending war between the truth and the lies online. It’s possible to minimize fake news by reporting fake articles. However, it’s easier to make fake news than reporting it and removing it. The companies and internet service providers would go hand-in-hand in trying to denounce fake news and the ones who create them would as well.

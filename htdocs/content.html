        <p>
          Fake news is news, stories or hoaxes created to deliberately misinform or deceive readers. Usually, these stories are created to either influence people’s views, push a political agenda or cause confusion and can often be a profitable business for online publishers. Fake news stories can deceive people by looking like trusted websites or using similar names and web addresses to reputable news organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fake News could be totally untrue or partially true. Fake News sites intending to be comedic are primary examples of these. These sites aim to entertain users by making fictional stories. They explicitly an ounce their intentions in the About us page. On the other hand, websites that are partially untrue are often discrete. These sites pose as legitimate articles to fool users.

              <h2>Confusion</h2>
              <p>
                Fake News could be a source of confusion. It spreads false information to its target audience to discourage and prohibit them from doing activities.
              </p>
              <h4>Example:</h4>
              <p>
                Fliers were distributed to trick college students. The Bangor Daily News reports that were fliers left on the campus of Bates College in Maine, telling students that if they wanted to vote in Lewiston, they would have to pay to change their driver’s licenses and re-register any vehicle in the city. These sorts of hoaxes are common on college campuses.
              </p>
              <h4>Analysis:</h4>
              <p>
                With the spread of these fliers, some people might not have voted because they couldn’t fulfill the requirements. This article is an example of fake news that influences the actions of people.

              <h2>Form of Propaganda</h2>
              <p>
                Politics is a major driver for fake news. It is used in order to sway the favor of people, to make other politicians appear bad, or to damage their reputation
              </p>
              <h4>Example:</h4>
              <p>
                Conservative Daily Post had published several false stories, including a report that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had both promised amnesty to undocumented immigrants who vote on the Democratic ticket. Neither person has made this promise to immigrants.
              </p>
              <h4>Analysis:</h4>
              <p>
                This article’s goal is to lower the reputation of the Democratic representative and Former President Obama. It is an example of fake news that poses as legitimate news sites.

              <h2>Source</h2>
              <p>
                The first thing to do is to check if it's a reliable website made by a trustworthy organization. Always ask the question: "who published this?" Is it also featured on the main page of the official website? Check the URL. If it ends with strange extensions that don't end with the usual ".com", be skeptical.

              <h2>Clickbait</h2>
              <p>
                Look beyond the headline: Check the entire article, many fake news stories use sensationalist or shocking headlines to grab attention. Often the headlines of fake news stories are in all caps and use exclamation points.
              </p>

              <h2>See Who Else Is Reporting the Story</h2>
              <p>
                Some fake news makes fake sources that look legitimate so it's always important to check the credibility of each source. Check if other reliable websites are featuring the article like GMA News and ABS-CBN. They are formal organizations that have professionals fact-checking data. Check the organization if it's legitimate or the website creator if they're trustworthy.

              <h2>Facts and Evidences</h2>
              <p>
                Fake news stories often contain incorrect dates or altered timelines. It is also a good idea to check when the article was published, is it current or an old news story? Statistics make it even more believable. Check where the so-called "statistics come" from.

                Are your views or beliefs affecting your judgment of a news feature or report? Just because you disagree with the news doesn't mean that it's fake. While browsing news, always be open-minded.

              <p>
                Satirical sites are famous online. Sometimes it is unclear whether or not a story is just a joke or parody. Check the website. Is it known for satire or creating funny stories?
